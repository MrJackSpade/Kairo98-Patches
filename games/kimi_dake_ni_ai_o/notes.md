# Kimi Dake ni Ai o (Cocktail Soft / Fairytale)

> This patch's script is a **machine translation (AI/MTL)**, not a human translation. It will be retired if a human translation is released.

Source image: `Kimi Dake ni Ai o/Kimi Dake ni Ai o... [FD]/Kimi Dake ni Ai o... (Disk A).hdm` (sha256 in `strings.json`).
Clearance: no PC-98 English release or announcement found on 2026-10-07 (`research/clearance.json`).

## Engine

ides' Adv98V script engine (`KIMI/`), on 3 floppies: 101 scripts with text (`MES/*.MES`, `*.MEC`) in its bytecode (`pc98tl/adv98v.py` documents it).  Every script tokenizes and rebuilds byte for byte.  The procedure table holds 20 slots of 76 bytes (read off the engine's memory).

The floppies have no room for a longer script, so the patch lays the game out on a DOS hard-disk image (every disk's files in `KIMI/`, with the scripts' drive letters taken off their file names, started as the floppy's boot does); the base image is the collection's `Naomi - Bishoujo-tachi no Yakata/Naomi - Bishoujo-tachi no Yakata [HD]/Naomi - Bishoujo-tachi no Yakata.hdi` with its own game removed.

## English display (`pc98tl/adv98v_tl.py`)

* The engine draws ASCII strings (`21 ... 00`) half-width itself, so English
  is written as ASCII strings in place of the Japanese text runs; the
  scripts are rebuilt with them (no offset table refers into a script).
* The engine wraps at the text frame's right edge even inside a word, and
  does not scroll (a fourth line of a 3-line frame draws over the first).
  So messages are broken between words to the frame's width (`A6` gives it
  in half-width columns) and cut into pages of its line count; between
  pages goes a wait and the file's message-end procedure call, as between
  the original messages.
* Menu items and text in one-line frames keep their Japanese width.
* Pieces of text with only colour, speed, pause or fade commands between
  them are one string; the English replaces all of it, without those
  effects.
* Procedures are read for what they print: a name tag ends its line, a fixed text (an ellipsis) or a name shown from a variable (its Japanese width) moves along it, a line break moves down, and a frame or text reset starts a fresh page.  A message continues the page of the text before it, wrapped from where that left off, with room left for what is printed after it.
* Procedures (`B9 n`) are copied into fixed slots of a table (one per number, run on into free slots after it); a build that would overrun one is refused.

## Script

2723 strings (2551 messages, 172 menu items).

Translation and the content classification (♥) are done by the translation model; 0 of 2723 strings have English so far.

## Limits

* Messages (`m` ids): any length; `\n` starts a new line.  Full-width characters can stay in the English; `{Uxxxx}` stand for the game's own characters (hearts, symbols) and are written back as they are.
* A script runs from the engine's script buffer, which holds 17100 bytes (read off its memory): a file that would outgrow it with the English is refused and named, so keep the longest scripts' English about as long as the Japanese.
* This engine hangs on an ASCII string inside a procedure, so text kept in procedures (the speakers' name tags, `n` ids) is written in full-width letters, each two columns wide and two bytes long; a tag grows only into its procedure's free slots, so keep tags about as long as the Japanese.
* Menu items (`i` ids), messages in one-line frames and text placed at a fixed spot on the screen (menu buttons, labels): twice their `max_cells` in letters; longer ones are cut and reported.

## Not handled

* Text drawn into the artwork (the title logo, pictures).

## Test status (np21w, `tools/boot_all.sh`)

| Test | Result |
|---|---|
| Opening (the wedding, the girl in blue, the woman in the office) | OK: filler wrapped between words to the box, pages waiting for a key; pictures change with the story |
| Menus, saving and loading, later scenes, endings | not yet seen |
| Gameplay past the opening scenes, save/load, endings | not yet seen |
