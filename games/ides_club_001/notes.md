# Ides User's Club Disk Magazine #001 (Cocktail Soft / Fairytale)

Clearance: no PC-98 English release or announcement found on 2026-10-07 (`research/clearance.json`).

## Engine

ides' Adv98V script engine (`IUC_001/`), on 1 floppies: 25 scripts with text (`MES/*.MES`, `*.MEC`) in its bytecode (`pc98tl/adv98v.py` documents it; this build has the later engines' extended opcodes).  Every script tokenizes and rebuilds byte for byte.  No procedure holds text, so no procedure grows.

The floppies have no room for a longer script, so the patch lays the game out on a DOS hard-disk image (every disk's files in `IUC_001/`, with the scripts' drive letters taken off their file names, started as the floppy's boot does); the base image is the collection's `Naomi - Bishoujo-tachi no Yakata/Naomi - Bishoujo-tachi no Yakata [HD]/Naomi - Bishoujo-tachi no Yakata.hdi` with its own game removed.

## English display (`pc98tl/adv98v_tl.py`)

* The engine draws ASCII strings (`21 ... 00`) half-width itself, so English
  is written as ASCII strings in place of the Japanese text runs; the
  scripts are rebuilt with them (no offset table refers into a script).
* The engine wraps at the text frame's right edge even inside a word, and
  does not scroll (a fourth line of a 3-line frame draws over the first).
  So messages are broken between words to the frame's width (`A6` gives it
  in half-width columns) and cut into pages of its line count; between
  pages goes a wait and the file's message-end procedure call, as between
  the original messages.
* Menu items and text in one-line frames keep their Japanese width.
* Pieces of text with only colour, speed, pause or fade commands between
  them are one string; the English replaces all of it, without those
  effects.
* Procedures are read for what they print: a name tag ends its line, a fixed text (an ellipsis) or a name shown from a variable (its Japanese width) moves along it, a line break moves down, and a frame or text reset starts a fresh page.  A message continues the page of the text before it, wrapped from where that left off, with room left for what is printed after it.
* The strings in the engine's programs are rewritten in place.

## Script

776 strings (721 messages, 52 menu items, 3 program strings).

Translation and the content classification (♥) are done by the translation model; 0 of 776 strings have English so far.

## Limits

* Messages (`m` ids): any length; `\n` starts a new line.  Full-width characters can stay in the English; `{Uxxxx}` stand for the game's own characters (hearts, symbols) and are written back as they are.
* A script runs from the engine's script buffer, which holds 17744 bytes (read off its memory): a file that would outgrow it with the English is refused and named, so keep the longest scripts' English about as long as the Japanese.
* Menu items (`i` ids), messages in one-line frames and text placed at a fixed spot on the screen (menu buttons, labels): twice their `max_cells` in letters; longer ones are cut and reported.
* Strings in `*.MEC` files: the engine loads these into one shared buffer, each at its own offset, so a `.MEC` file can only grow up to the next file's offset (or, for the top one, as far as the original game's loads reach; past that the buffer meets the engine's stack), often only a few dozen bytes past its Japanese.  The patcher refuses a build where one outgrows its room and lists that file's strings.
* Program strings (`e` ids): twice `max_cells` in letters, written in place; longer ones are cut and reported.

## Not handled

* Text drawn into the artwork (the title logo, pictures).

## Test status (np21w, `tools/boot_all.sh`)

| Test | Result |
|---|---|
| Title and the magazine menu (the hostess beside it) | OK: filler heading and items at their places, the highlight on the first |
| The magazine's explanation pages | OK: filler wrapped in the page frame, the key-prompt line at the foot, returning to the menu |
| The other pages, the shop, exit | not yet seen |
| Gameplay past the opening scenes, save/load, endings | not yet seen |
