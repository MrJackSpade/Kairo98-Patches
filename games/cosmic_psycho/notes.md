# Cosmic Psycho (Cocktail Soft / Fairytale)

> This patch's script is a **machine translation (AI/MTL)**, not a human translation. It will be retired if a human translation is released.

Source image: `Cosmic Psycho/Cosmic Psycho [FD hd9]/Cosmic Psycho (Disk A).d88` (sha256 in `strings.json`).
Clearance: no PC-98 English release or announcement found on 2026-10-03 (`research/clearance.json`).

## Engine

ides' Adv98V script engine (`/`), on 3 floppies: 100 scripts with text (`MES/*.MES`, `*.MEC`) in its bytecode (`pc98tl/adv98v.py` documents it).  Every script tokenizes and rebuilds byte for byte.  The procedure table holds 20 slots of 102 bytes (read off the engine's memory).

This is ADVH, the engine before Adv98V (`ADVH.EXE`, run by `ADVSHELL.COM`): the same bytecode, but no ASCII string command, and every character drawn as a 16x16 glyph.  The patch adds half-width letters to the program (`pc98tl/advh.py`): each English letter is written as `85 xx` (xx its ASCII code), which the program draws from the BIOS's 8x16 font one column wide and steps the cursor one column on; the program is unpacked, patched and packed again with its own EXEPACK unpacker.  Its disk-change command (wait for disk X in the floppy drive) goes straight on.  Messages page with the key wait `81 90`, which clears the box: a message longer than the box goes on after a key on a fresh page.

The floppies have no room for a longer script, so the patch lays the game out on a DOS hard-disk image (every disk's files in `/`, with the scripts' drive letters taken off their file names, started as the floppy's boot does); the base image is the collection's `Naomi - Bishoujo-tachi no Yakata/Naomi - Bishoujo-tachi no Yakata [HD]/Naomi - Bishoujo-tachi no Yakata.hdi` with its own game removed.

## English display (`pc98tl/adv98v_tl.py`)

* The engine draws ASCII strings (`21 ... 00`) half-width itself, so English
  is written as ASCII strings in place of the Japanese text runs; the
  scripts are rebuilt with them (no offset table refers into a script).
* The engine wraps at the text frame's right edge even inside a word, and
  does not scroll (a fourth line of a 3-line frame draws over the first).
  So messages are broken between words to the frame's width (`A6` gives it
  in half-width columns) and cut into pages of its line count; between
  pages goes a wait and the file's message-end procedure call, as between
  the original messages.
* Menu items and text in one-line frames keep their Japanese width.
* Pieces of text with only colour, speed, pause or fade commands between
  them are one string; the English replaces all of it, without those
  effects.
* A message after a speaker's name tag (a procedure that ends its line) starts on the frame's second line.
* Procedures are read for what they print: a name tag ends its line, a fixed text (an ellipsis) or a name shown from a variable (its Japanese width) moves along it, a line break moves down, and a frame or text reset starts a fresh page.  A message continues the page of the text before it, wrapped from where that left off, with room left for what is printed after it.
* Procedures (`B9 n`) are copied into fixed slots of a table (one per number, run on into free slots after it); a build that would overrun one is refused.
* String variables' values (`@n='...'` arguments) and the strings in the engine's programs are rewritten in place.

## Script

7854 strings (7586 messages, 197 menu items, 64 name tags (procedure text), 1 string variable values, 6 program strings).

Translation and the content classification (♥) are done by the translation model; 0 of 7854 strings have English so far.

## Limits

* Messages (`m` ids): any length; `\n` starts a new line.  Full-width characters can stay in the English; `{Uxxxx}` stand for the game's own characters (hearts, symbols) and are written back as they are.
* This old build ends each message with a key wait (`81 90`) that clears the box, so pages are split with it; in its one-line box a message pages a line at a time.
* Menu items (`i` ids), messages in one-line frames and text placed at a fixed spot on the screen (menu buttons, labels): twice their `max_cells` in letters; longer ones are cut and reported.
* Name tags (`n` ids) live in procedures, and a procedure may only grow into the free slots after its own (102 bytes a slot), so the tags of one procedure share a few bytes beyond the Japanese: keep names about as long as the Japanese ones.  The patcher refuses a build that overruns a slot and names that procedure's strings.
* String variables (`v` ids): the Japanese's byte length (twice `max_cells` in letters).  Longer ones are refused.  `'` and `"` are written full-width (they would end the script's quoting).
* Program strings (`e` ids): twice `max_cells` in letters, written in place; longer ones are cut and reported.

## Not handled

* Text drawn into the artwork (the title logo, pictures).

## Test status (np21w, `tools/boot_all.sh`)

| Test | Result |
|---|---|
| Floppy set laid out on a hard disk; start menu | OK: boots from the hard disk (disk-change waits skipped); menu items as half-width filler |
| Timed opening (credits, narration) | OK: half-width filler, each page paced by the opening's own timed pause (it takes no keys) |
| Dialogue in the one-line box (name, ellipsis inserts) | OK: name procedure, filler runs and ellipsis procedures on one line, paged a line at a time |
| Title screen after the opening, first office scene | OK: reached; English drawn half-width; no memory error after scenes (the helper sits in the disk-check routines, not in a buffer) |
| Command menus, save/load, later acts (disk B and C files), endings | not yet seen |
| Gameplay past the opening scenes, save/load, endings | not yet seen |
