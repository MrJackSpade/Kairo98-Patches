# Doki Doki Vacation (Cocktail Soft / Fairytale)

> This patch's script is a **machine translation (AI/MTL)**, not a human translation. It will be retired if a human translation is released.

Source image: `Doki Doki Vacation/Doki Doki Vacation [FD]/Doki Doki Vacation (Disk A).hdm` (sha256 in `strings.json`).
Clearance: no PC-98 English release or announcement found on 2026-10-03 (`research/clearance.json`).

## Engine

ides' Adv98V script engine (`DOKIV/`), on 8 floppies: 156 scripts with text (`MES/*.MES`, `*.MEC`) in its bytecode (`pc98tl/adv98v.py` documents it; this build has the later engines' extended opcodes).  Every script tokenizes and rebuilds byte for byte.  The procedure table holds 20 slots of 76 bytes (read off the engine's memory).

The floppies have no room for a longer script, so the patch lays the game out on a DOS hard-disk image (every disk's files in `DOKIV/`, with the scripts' drive letters taken off their file names, started as the floppy's boot does); the base image is the collection's `Custom Mate 3/Custom Mate 3 [HD]/Custom Mate 3.hdi` with its own game removed.

## English display (`pc98tl/adv98v_tl.py`)

* The engine draws ASCII strings (`21 ... 00`) half-width itself, so English
  is written as ASCII strings in place of the Japanese text runs; the
  scripts are rebuilt with them (no offset table refers into a script).
* The engine wraps at the text frame's right edge even inside a word, and
  does not scroll (a fourth line of a 3-line frame draws over the first).
  So messages are broken between words to the frame's width (`A6` gives it
  in half-width columns) and cut into pages of its line count; between
  pages goes a wait and the file's message-end procedure call, as between
  the original messages.
* Menu items and text in one-line frames keep their Japanese width.
* A message after a speaker's name tag (a procedure that ends its line) starts on the frame's second line.
* Procedures are read for what they print: a name tag ends its line, a fixed text (an ellipsis) or a name shown from a variable (its Japanese width) moves along it, a line break moves down, and a frame or text reset starts a fresh page.  A message continues the page of the text before it, wrapped from where that left off, with room left for what is printed after it.
* Procedures (`B9 n`) are copied into fixed slots of a table (one per number, run on into free slots after it); a build that would overrun one is refused.
* String variables' values (`@n='...'` arguments) and the strings in the engine's programs are rewritten in place.

## Script

11683 strings (50 name tags (procedure text), 11194 messages, 436 menu items, 2 string variable values, 1 program strings).

Translation and the content classification (♥) are done by the translation model; 0 of 11683 strings have English so far.

## Limits

* Messages (`m` ids): any length; `\n` starts a new line.  Full-width characters can stay in the English; `{Uxxxx}` stand for the game's own characters (hearts, symbols) and are written back as they are.
* Menu items (`i` ids), messages in one-line frames and text placed at a fixed spot on the screen (menu buttons, labels): twice their `max_cells` in letters; longer ones are cut and reported.
* Name tags (`n` ids) live in procedures, and a procedure may only grow into the free slots after its own (76 bytes a slot), so the tags of one procedure share a few bytes beyond the Japanese: keep names about as long as the Japanese ones.  The patcher refuses a build that overruns a slot and names that procedure's strings.
* String variables (`v` ids): the Japanese's byte length (twice `max_cells` in letters).  Longer ones are refused.  `'` and `"` are written full-width (they would end the script's quoting).
* Program strings (`e` ids): twice `max_cells` in letters, written in place; longer ones are cut and reported.

## Not handled

* Text drawn into the artwork (the title logo, pictures).

## Test status (np21w, `tools/boot_all.sh`)

| Test | Result |
|---|---|
| Eight floppies laid out on a hard disk; title menu | OK: boots from the hard disk (Custom Mate 3's DOS image as the base, the only one in the family with room); menu items fixed width |
| Opening classroom scene | OK: speaker tags on the first line, the message under them wrapped between words, 2-line pages |
| First in-game menus | OK: filler items at their Japanese width |
| Save/load, later days (other disks' files), endings | not yet seen |
| Gameplay past the opening scenes, save/load, endings | not yet seen |
