# Saori - Bishoujo-tachi no Yakata (Cocktail Soft / Fairytale)

> This patch's script is a **machine translation (AI/MTL)**, not a human translation. It will be retired if a human translation is released.

Source image: `Saori - Bishoujo-tachi no Yakata/Saori - Bishoujo-tachi no Yakata [HD]/Saori - Bishoujo-tachi no Yakata.hdi` (sha256 in `strings.json`).
Clearance: no PC-98 English release or announcement found on 2026-10-02 (`research/clearance.json`).

## Engine

ides' Adv98V script engine (`SAORI/`), on a hard-disk image: 69 scripts with text (`MES/*.MES`, `*.MEC`) in its bytecode (`pc98tl/adv98v.py` documents it).  Every script tokenizes and rebuilds byte for byte.  No procedure holds text, so no procedure grows.

## English display (`pc98tl/adv98v_tl.py`)

* The engine draws ASCII strings (`21 ... 00`) half-width itself, so English
  is written as ASCII strings in place of the Japanese text runs; the
  scripts are rebuilt with them (no offset table refers into a script).
* The engine wraps at the text frame's right edge even inside a word, and
  does not scroll (a fourth line of a 3-line frame draws over the first).
  So messages are broken between words to the frame's width (`A6` gives it
  in half-width columns) and cut into pages of its line count; between
  pages goes a wait and the file's message-end procedure call, as between
  the original messages.
* Menu items and text in one-line frames keep their Japanese width.
* Pieces of text with only colour, speed, pause or fade commands between
  them are one string; the English replaces all of it, without those
  effects.
* Procedures are read for what they print: a name tag ends its line, a fixed text (an ellipsis) or a name shown from a variable (its Japanese width) moves along it, a line break moves down, and a frame or text reset starts a fresh page.  A message continues the page of the text before it, wrapped from where that left off, with room left for what is printed after it.

## Script

4905 strings (4665 messages, 240 menu items).

Translation and the content classification (♥) are done by the translation model; 0 of 4905 strings have English so far.

## Limits

* Messages (`m` ids): any length; `\n` starts a new line.  Full-width characters can stay in the English; `{Uxxxx}` stand for the game's own characters (hearts, symbols) and are written back as they are.
* This old build ends each message with a key wait (`81 90`) that clears the box, so pages are split with it (in a one-line box, a line at a time).
* This engine draws menus from Shift-JIS only (an ASCII string in a menu crashes it), so menu items are written in full-width letters: `max_cells` letters each, cut and padded.
* Menu items (`i` ids), messages in one-line frames and text placed at a fixed spot on the screen (menu buttons, labels): twice their `max_cells` in letters; longer ones are cut and reported.

## Not handled

* Text drawn into the artwork (the title logo, pictures).

## Test status (np21w, `tools/boot_all.sh`)

| Test | Result |
|---|---|
| Start menu | OK: full-width filler items (this old engine takes Shift-JIS only in menus) |
| Opening scene messages | OK: filler wrapped to the one-line box (63 columns), each line its own page with the key wait |
| First in-game menu and a choice | OK: full-width filler items; the choice goes on to the next messages |
| Save/load, later scenes, endings | not yet seen |
| Gameplay past the opening scenes, save/load, endings | not yet seen |
